# XRS Content Integration

This section details how one can create their content for the XRS stage with the provided template files and 3D assets.

First, familiarize yourself with our content delivery system via the [Content Delivery via Perforce](docs/content/perforce.md) guide. You'll need Perforce to receive some files (like the Unreal template file) as well as to deliver your finished content.

Once perforce is ready, get the [Template Files](docs/content/templates.md) and head to the [Notch](docs/content/notch.md) or [Unreal](docs/content/unreal.md) XR Content Guides to get started developing your content for the XR stage.
